This is a free release into the public domain.

Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, or
distribute this software, either in source code form or as a compiled
binary, for any non-commercial purpose, and by any
means.

I'm not a legal expert, so if anything about this project raises concern,
please directly contact me, and I'd be more than happy to discuss there.

Any direct rearrangements/restorations/recreations of the music from Halo 1
should be technically considered overs of O'Donnell and Salvatori's work.

It is not my intention to infringe on/plagiarize/profit of any kind from that work.
For me, this project is out of passion for the original soundtrack, and an exercise to
improve my technique making music, and gain more insight into the development process behind the music of Halo.
Please be sure to credit the real heroes behind this stuff and indicate this is a cover where it applies.

Everything here is for use in content related to Halo: Combat Evolved or Halo Custom Edition.
This means CE maps, but also includes media like YouTube videos of Halo content.
Feel free to use this music for videos! Just be sure to link this github project as a credit (mainly to read this disclaimer).
