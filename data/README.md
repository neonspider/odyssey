# "REPLACERS"

 - - TO BE EDITED FOR NEW STRUCTURE - -

Directory for music designed for cutscenes/to play only once.

	stems = Individual tracks, allowing for mix'n'match

	seq = MIDI Sequence, notation, melody, etc. v1 would be draft/quantized sequencing, and v2 would be a dynamics and enhancement pass on per instrument basis.

	inst = Instrumentation, timbres, the actual "sound" of the instruments you hear in the track. v1 is recreated/faithful instrumentation, v2 is work on alternate variations

	mix = Track mixing, EQ, volumes. v1 is general playback prototype, mixed "enough". v2 is mixed for gameplay, v3 is mastered for album/soundtrack listening

	(*).v(*) - (*%) = [part of track development], v [revision/version], [rough percentage estimate]
