# "SKETCHES"
Directory for ideas, drafts, mockups, sketches and various creations of Odyssey development.

Many tracks will appear in this folder before they ship out to basic/other music folders.

"Full tracks" without suitable sequence fidelity will also be here (without stems).

Currently contains:

	brother_strings - Early dev sketch for Brothers in Arms - Virtuoso 2000 strings audition test.
	fast_new - "fast_sketch" - Recreation test.
	fast_newdance - Outtake, with Covenant Dance bassline.
	halo_test - Proteus VX test, note cutoffs bc polyphony limits w single VST instance.
	iron - Early sketch - Gun Pointed at the Head of the Universe
	iron_night - Outtake - Guns/Cover of Night mashup, sorta has an ODST vibe imo.
